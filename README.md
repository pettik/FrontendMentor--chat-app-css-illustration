## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, I need a strong understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

This challenge is to build out this feature illustration using HTML & CSS and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The only assets we provide in this challenge are the image of the person in the app UI and the 3 images of the dog. You need to create everything else using HTML & CSS!
